# Quoridor (3.0)

This is the third form of my Quoridor application, now with support for online play
## Instructions for Build and Use

(Software demo pending - I will not have what I need to record it until Monday)

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The software is already built and ready!
2. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, so you can run this Java application
3. Double-click Quoridor_Client.jar in your file explorer to launch

If you want to connect to your own server, not the one I have hosted at https://portfolio-quoridor-server.onrender.com, you will need to set "baseUrl" in the ServerProxy class to the location of your new server, then re-build the .jar file.

Instructions for using the software:

1. All menus and options are controlled by clicking with the mouse.
2. For rules of play of Quoridor, see the Rules page in the application
3. For help with the gameplay controls, see the Help page available in local games
4. 

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* IntelliJ IDEA
* Kotlin
* LibGDX with Scene2D
* Ktor

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [LibGDX Wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki)
* [From the Ground Up: Scene2D.UI Tutorials](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/wiki/From-the-Ground-Up:-Scene2D.UI-Tutorials)
* [LibGDX Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libgdx/)
* [Ktor Documentation](https://ktor.io/docs)


## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Allow players to choose their own name/color
* [ ] Make my own graphical skin, rather than use a pre-baked one
* [ ] Create a version to run from other device types
