# Quoridor (2.0)

This is an adaptation of my command-line Quoridor application, giving it graphics and mouse interaction using LibGDX
## Instructions for Build and Use

(Software demo not available for this version - this project will soon be expanded for online play, and that update will have a demo)

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. The software is already built and ready!
2. Make sure you have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed, so you can run this Java application
3. Double-click Quoridor_GUI.jar in your file explorer to launch

Instructions for using the software:

1. All menus and options are controlled by clicking with the mouse.
2. For rules of play of Quoridor, see the Rules page in the application
3. For help with the gameplay controls, see the Help page available once the game begins

## Development Environment

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* IntelliJ IDEA
* Kotlin
* LibGDX with Scene2D

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [LibGDX Wiki](https://libgdx.com/wiki)
* [From the Ground Up: Scene2D.UI Tutorials](https://github.com/raeleus/skin-composer/wiki/From-the-Ground-Up:-Scene2D.UI-Tutorials)
* [LibGDX Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/libgdx/)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Convert to support a client/server architecture for multiplayer across devices
* [ ] Allow players to choose their own name/color
* [ ] Make my own graphical skin, rather than use a pre-baked one
